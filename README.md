# CO102
This is for CO102 practical codes,this will help students to get their desired output , all the codes are in their respective order of their experiments. Three branches have been created for their codes namely "prog_1to5","prog_1to10 , prog_11to15"...more branches will be created as per the needs \ 
If anyone is having any different code then he/she can give me a PR and I'll review the code then merege it. \
One can either use a local repo or you can use https://vscode.dev/ this site and open this repo or a repo which you have forked it to open the codes \
